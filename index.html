            <p ID="BEEP">I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and develop learning skills.
                <br>
                
               Drawing helps improve your hand-eye coordination. The more you draw, the better your brain, your eyes and your hands harmonize. ... Drawing helps enhance the development of their brain by putting all parts of the brain to work.
                <br>
                In conclusion I think drawing is AMAZING!!!!!!!!
